## Overview
* What is Machine Learning?
  * Machine Learning is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience.
* How should I go about learning Machine Learning?
  * MOOCs
  * Don't get caught up in the implementations. 
* Tools
  * WEKA
  * scikit-learn

## Some Boring, but important Definitions.
* Inductive Bias
  * The inductive bias of a learning algorithm is the set of assumptions that the learner uses to predict outputs given inputs that it has not encountered.
  * Occam's Razor assumes that the hypotheses with the fewest assumptions should be selected.
* Cross-validation
  * The basic idea of Cross-validation to leave out some of the data when fitting the model.
* Overfitting
  *

## Scikit-learn
* Scikit-learn is a set of simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis.
